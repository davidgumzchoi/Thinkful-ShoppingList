// Project 2: Javascript “Hot or Cold”

// OVERVIEW
// In this project, starting from scratch you’ll build a JavaScript version of "Hot or Cold" (commonly known as "Huckle buckle beanstalk", obviously!).
// You remember the game, don't you? The hider knows where one object is, and a seeker has to find it.
// Each time the seeker makes a guess, the hider responds "getting hotter" if she's getting closer, or "getting colder" if she's moved farther away.
// For your version of the game, the computer will be hiding a number, and your user will be trying to find it.

// To build this game, you should use functions, conditionals, random numbers, and a "scoped" variable as described here (http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter3.html#p9d662d5).
// This should help you understand the mindset of a programmer.

// APP REQUIREMENTS
// On page load, Javascript should pick a number at random that user will have to guess.
// The user should be prompted to enter a guess.
// The user should get feedback about their guess -if it was too high, too low, or just right.
// Initially, don't worry about telling users if they're getting "hotter" or "colder", just tell them if there previous guess was "hot" or "cold".
// For your initial version, feel free to use the built-in "prompt()" function to get user guesses, and the "alert()" function to give feedback on the user guess.
// For the final version of your project, you'll need to create an HTML-based interface for getting user inputs and giving feedback on guesses.
// Your app should ensure that users provide valid inputs.
// For instance, if a user submits a spaces, a blank guess, or letters, they should receive feedback that they need to input a number.
// The app should feature a button that allows the user to start a new game, without making additional calls to the server
// Make sure to use version control as you're working on this project, committing early and often.

// STEPS
// Starting from scratch, in a brand new repository, create a web page that meets the requirements listed above.
// Once you’ve got a working version, push it to Github (and host a version on Github pages) and a share it with your mentor and classmates to get feedback.
// If you're feeling adventurous, consider adding the following additional features to improve the game:
// Using another correctly scoped variable, iteratively track the user's previous guess in order to let them know if they are getting “hotter” or “colder”.
// If you’re more visual, you can add animations using jQuery.
